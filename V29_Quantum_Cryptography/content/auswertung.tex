\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:Auswertung}

All measurement sequences were conducted as laid out in section \ref{sec:Durchführung} in the corresponding order. All of the runs use random basis choices genrated 
by the \texttt{NumPy} function \texttt{numpy.random.default\_rng}. The bits and trits that Alice transmits are also generated by the same function. 

\subsection{Standard BB84 \-- \, no Eve}

Of the $N_{total} = \num{52}$ transmitted pulses sent, The bases of Alice and Bob matched in $N_{match} = \num{31}$ cases, which is the sifted key length. The number 
of errors in this run is $N_{error} = \num{0}$, which is expected for a clean and 
uninterrupted transmission. The quantum bit error rate (QBER) is therefore also $QBER = \num{0}$. This yields identical sifted keys for Alice and Bob, which in this case are 
$K_A = K_B = 1010\,1001\,1100\,0111\,0000\,1101\,0110\,111$. This key can be used as a one-time pad for symmetric encryption.

\subsection{Standard BB84 \-- \, with Eve}

The second run introduces Eve as an eavesdropper. With the same number of transmitted pulses, the number of matching bases is now $N_{match} = \num{26}$. 
The bit error rate is $N_{error} = \num{2}$, corresponding to a QBER of $QBER = \SI{7.7}{\percent}$. This leads to differing sifted keys for Alice and Bob, which 
cannot be used for secure encryption without further processing. 

\subsection{Decoy State BB84 \-- \, no Eve}

In this run, the decoy state method as described in section \ref{sec:Theorie} is used. In this first version, this is done without Eve. With again $N_{total} = \num{52}$ 
the number of matching bases is $N_{match} = \num{21}$. Here, Alice transmits trits (0,1,2) instead of bits, as is also laid out in section \ref{sec:Theorie}. All of 
the trit classes yield zero errors, meaning the total error rate and QBER are again zero. The sifted key could thus again be use as a one-time pad for encryption. 

\subsection{Decoy State BB84 \-- \, with Eve}

In this final run, Eve is again introduced as an eavesdropper. The sifted key length this time is $N_{match} = \num{29}$, with $N_{error} = \num{6}$ errors, meaning 
a QBER of $QBER = \SI{20.7}{\percent}$. As described in section \ref{sec:Theorie}, the decoy states are given by \texttt{g+1} and \texttt{rx1}. Due to Eve's interception,
these states are measured by Bob a total of 8 times in events no. (4, 10, 18, 27, 33, 35, 37, 40). None of these events survived the sifting process however which 
means the sifted number of decoy states that are measured by Bob is $N_{decoy} = \num{0}$.
