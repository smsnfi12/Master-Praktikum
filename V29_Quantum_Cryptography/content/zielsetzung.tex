\section{Aim of the Experiment}
\label{sec:Zielsetzung}
The aim of this experiment is to explore the principles of quantum cryptography, specifically focusing on the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol and its decoy state extension.
The main objectives are to implement key generation, identify the presence of an eavesdropper, and analyze the role of decoy states.
